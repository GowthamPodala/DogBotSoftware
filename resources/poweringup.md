# General

**Ensure you have read all relevent documentation regarding safe operation of the equipment before connecting or switching on your DogBot** 

**When carrying its own weight, DogBot must run from batteries**

**Recharge batteries when voltage dips below 26V**

There are two power options for DogBot, mains power or batteries.  The batteries are better able to accept the large returned currents when the motors are slowed down, and so should not produce voltage spikes as large as might be created when operating from a bench supply.  For this reason, use the batteries when operating DogBot nuder load, including carrying its own weight.

# Battery Safety

DogBot carries two powerful lithium ion batteries. Please take care in operation, and read all documenation for the battery chargers you use.

As a reminder of why, here's a short [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6iYxd9lJpA) of a lithium ion battery being recharged at a NASA facility.  And the [longer clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JECJAgRsp-4) shows how hard to resulting fire is to deal with.

# Bench Supply Operation

* Switch the breaker off (green)
* Move the power switch to horizontal position
* Ensure batteries are disconnected
* Connect power supply
* Switch on breaker
* Switch on power switch (down position)
* Switch on bench supply

Use a voltage around 25V  (this is lower than battery voltage, to acccommodate the possibility of higher voltage spikes)

# Batter Operation

## Connecting the Batteries

* Switch the breaker off (green)
* Move the power switch to horizontal position
* Ensure power supply is disconnected
* Connect the batteries on each side
* Hold the power switch in the up position for 5 seconds
* Switch the breaker on
* Switch on power switch (down position)

Holding the power switch is to allow the capacitors to charge

## Disconnecting the Batteries

* Switch the breaker off (green)
* Move the power switch to horizontal position
* Disconnect the batteries

## Monitoring and recharging

The UI has a power supply column in the overview page, headed 'Supply'.  The voltage should generally read around 34V, if it dips below 26V the batteries should be recharged.

NB - the batteries are not designed to be fully discharged, they will be damaged if run down to lower voltages.
