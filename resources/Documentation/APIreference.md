# DogBot API Reference

The DogBot API provides a rich interface, to drive DogBot at the level of individual servos, leg positions, or encapsulated walking gaits, as well as general monitoring and administration functions.

This reference is primarily help files generated from the source code, to assist in using both the C++ and Python API.  Note that not all methods will be available via the Python implementation.

This does not cover driving DogBot from ROS nodes, which is abstracted across ROS controller topics.
