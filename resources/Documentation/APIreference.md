# DogBot API Reference

The DogBot API provides a rich interface, to drive DogBot at the level of individual servos, leg positions, or encapsulated walking gaits, as well as gernal monitoring and administration functions.

This API reference includes generated help files from the API source code, to assist in using the DogBot API.  Note that not all methods will be available via the Python implementation.

This does not cover driving DogBot via ROS, which is abstracted across ROS controller topics.
